Python 3 solutions to the exercises in Zed Shaw's *Learn Python the Hard Way*. Done as an exercise in developing a more "Pythonic" style of coding. [What's New in Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html) is an indispensable resource for when things don't work.

Read *Learn Python the Hard Way* at http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ and find additional material at [the author's own GitHub](https://github.com/zedshaw/lpthw-study-projects).

If you're new to programming, you should definitely follow the author's advice and do these exercises in Python 2 instead. I am a trained professional.
